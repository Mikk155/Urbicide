INTRO_MESSAGE1
{
Andersen went out a couple of hours ago but I haven't
heard from him since. Hope he's okay.

The gate to the warehouse got stuck from a nearby shockwave
so we made a makeshift staircase, stacking a bunch of shit,
in order to gain access to the window above. A dangerous but
necessary task if we want to get out of this goddamn mess.
}

INTRO_MESSAGE2
{
I decided to stay here in case someone tried to contact us.
So far I haven't heard anything.

Apparently there's been some sort of invasion... aliens? Fuck if I know.
Andersen and I heard it on the radio. Gunfire and distant bombings has
filled the air the last couple of few hours. Sounds like hell outside.

INTRO_MESSAGE3
{
My fiance is holed up in an apartment not far from the local hospital.
I need to get there, find her and then get the fuck outta dodge.

My military training from years ago ought to hopefully still hold up.

ANDERSEN
{
Damnit, Andersen... he only had two days left until retirement...
}

STREETS
{
Unless I want to end up like these guys I should probably keep a
low profile and stay off the streets just to be safe.
}

NAILED_DOOR
{
The door is nailed shut. I should look around and see if I can
find something to tear down the board.
}

LOCKED_GRATE
{
Damnit, the grate is locked. If I could only find a weapon to
shoot the yellow lock to break it.
}

KEY1
{
I picked up a key. Could be useful.
}

KEY_LOCKED
{
Door is locked. Must be a key somewhere around here.
}

CANDY
{
Om nom nom!
}

CANDY2
{
Gotta go easy on the sugar there...
}

SEWER_SHIT
{
The hospital shouldn't be too far off. I just have to wade
through this shit-infested sludge. Oh boy.
}

HOSPITAL_BASEMENT
{
This must be the basement of the hospital. I should check
and see if I can find a working elevator.
}

HOSPITAL_ELEV
{
I should check out the elevator. Perhaps it's working now.
}

HOSPITAL_MAIN
{
It's a goddamn warzone out there. The rooftop is probably
a safer area to traverse. I should look for an elevator
that takes me to the roof... or perhaps the stairs are
a better alternative.
}

FUCKING_KEY
{
Well, what a surprise. The goddamn door is locked. 
}

KEY_CARD
{
Found a key card. I should go back to the main entrance
and see if this card works on the door to the stairwell.
}

DUMPSTER
{
Aim for the bushes?... uh, I mean garbage pile.
}

TOO_OLD
{
I'm getting too old for this shit.
}

REBECCA
{
Rebecca...!? FUCK! Gotta get to the fourth floor.
